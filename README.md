Play audio from YouTube.

## Description
Does a basic search on YouTube, and plays the first result as audio.

Based on the I Heart Radio and Tunein skills by johnbartkiw.

This is still untidy, but the basic functionality works.

This project is a fork from the aweosme mcdruid work that can be found here :

I want this plugin only to load few chill music, so if u want it just download it bro ! :)

## Examples
